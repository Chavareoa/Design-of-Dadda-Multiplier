# Design-of-Dadda-Multiplier
− Designed a 16 x 16 Dadda Multiplier in Verilog with a Brent Kung adder for the final addition.
− Verified the design operation through simulation in ModelSim with appropriate test vectors.
− Identified the critical path and computed the worst case delay using the specified component delays.
